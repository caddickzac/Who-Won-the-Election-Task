## Overview:
The materials presented here are from Zachary A. Caddick's doctoral dissertation. The dissertation research project includes four studies. Each of the studies used related, but distinct stimuli. The organization of the information is grouped by study number.


## Stimuli File Naming Information

### Study 1

Version A & B refer to counterbalancing stimuli. Verion B is a "mirror reflection" of Version A's data. Participants either completed Version A or Version B, but not both. 

### Study 2

Version A & B refer to counterbalancing stimuli. Verion B is a "mirror reflection" of Version A's data. Participants completed both versions, at different time points. Participants were randomly assigned to complete either Version A or Version B first. 

### Study 3

Version A & B refer to condition assignment. Version A is the condition with both raw and summary data. Version B is the condition with raw data only. Participants were randomly assigned to only one of the conditions.

### Study 4

Versions A, B, & C refer to condition assignment. Version A is the condition with both raw and summary data. Version B is the condition with raw data only. Version  C is the condition with summary data only. Participants were randomly assigned to only one of the conditions.

## Qualtrics Survey Materials, R Scripts, and Stimuli

The QSF, or “Qualtrics Survey Format” file has been uploaded for each study so that exact details can be reviewed. Additionally, a Microsoft Word version of each survey has been uploaded (although this process created formatting issues during export).
