For example, how does a group of friends decide which pizza toppings to order, or how to elect a candidate, or a how a hiring committee chooses who to hire.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Procedures:&nbsp;<\/b><br \/>\nYou will see examples of how individuals vote for different candidates and decide which candidate you think should win. For example, you might learn about people&rsquo;s preferences for certain outcomes (e.g., favorite pizza toppings), and decide which competing outcome is most fair (e.g., which pizza should be ordered for a group of friends given their preferences). Or you may see votes for job candidates and decide which job candidate you think should win. Additionally, you will be asked questions about certain attitudes and beliefs you hold (e.g., ethics, attitudes about math).<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Requirements:<\/b>\n<ol>\n\t<li>You must be 18 years or older.<\/li>\n\t<li>You must understand English fluently.<\/li>\n\t<li>You must use one of the following Internet browsers: Google Chrome or Firefox.

This works by first counting all voters first preference and seeing if any candidate has over 50% support. If so, this candidate wins. If not, then the candidate with the least amount of support is &quot;eliminated&quot;&nbsp;and their votes are re-assigned to their next favorite candidate. The votes are then counted again to see if a candidate has over 50% support.<\/i><br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>In <strong>plurality<\/strong> voting a winning candidate needs to have more votes than any other candidate but does not necessarily need to have over 50% of the votes to win.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>","DataExportTag":"vsp_vRCV_Info_P3","QuestionID":"QID429"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_4UtGKpjcG10SroG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID235","SecondaryAttribute":"Reset Candidates Avg.
